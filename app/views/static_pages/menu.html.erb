	<h3>bahn mi fries</h3>
		<p>Naturally dyed pink from lavender buds, this sparkling lemonade is squeezed with fresh lemons offering a delicately citrus floral drink.  Inspired by soda fountains and satisfying the inner child in all of us. Each vanilla bean stem is individually cut, with the addition of the fresh and tangy juice from Californian oranges, to create the organic cream soda we're all craving.</p>
